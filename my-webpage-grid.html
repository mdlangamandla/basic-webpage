                    The city I would love to visit is Madrid in Spain. Here are my reasons why I would like to visit Madrid. 
                    You got to appreciate a stunning sunset view from the Egyptian Temple of Debod, originally built in Egypt, and dismantled and reconstructed in Madrid. 
                    Settle down for a selection of tapas and fine wine in the Plaza de Santa Ana, and watch the city go about its day. 
                    Experience the sights, sounds and smells of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid, covering 20 acres and containing around 30,000 plants and flowers.
                    Immerse yourself in the culture of Spain’s National Art Museum, the Prado, which houses paintings by Goya, Velázquez and other Spanish Masters dating from the 12th Century to the early 20th Century.
                    And taking a tour around Real Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.
